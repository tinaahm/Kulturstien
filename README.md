# Kulturstien

An iOS application created for RÃ¦lingen Kommune for our second-year project with the aim of engaging and teaching both locals and visitors about the history of the surrounding area. Through the use of games, AR and an easy-to-use interface our goal was to create an app that is both educational and fun to use.

The prototype for the app can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/KbHWtN12B73gD6U4gamPwj/Endelig-prototype-V%C3%A5r-2022?node-id=0%3A1).
